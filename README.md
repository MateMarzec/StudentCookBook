# StudentCookBook

A Student Cook Book is a blog that documents anything from recipes that the author wants to try or experiment, restaurant reviews, or even a journal-style delivery about a person's life choices.

## Description

Food blogging represents a complex interweaving of “foodie” or gourmet interest in cooking with those of blog writing and photography. The majority of blogs use pictures taken by the author himself/herself and some of them focus specifically on food photography. Student Cook Book is a simple blog build on Bootstrap. Why it is simple? The answer is because people looking for a recipe are usually do not pay attention to many design details but to context. Of course the website has to be clear and good looking and this is what the Student Cook Book is. The navigation through the website is clear and easy to use. This project is fully responsive, however it is just sample product. All recipes included on this site was copied from https://www.bbcgoodfood.com.
